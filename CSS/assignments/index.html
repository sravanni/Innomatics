      <p>Coffee preparation is the making of liquid coffee using coffee beans. While the particular steps vary with the
        type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps: raw coffee beans must be
        roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be ground, and the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot or cold
        water (depending on the method of brewing) for a specific time (brewed), the liquid coffee extraction must be
        separated from the usedhe used grounds, and finally, if desired, the extracted coffee is combined with other
        elements of the desired beverage, such as sweeteners, dairy products, dairy alternatives, or toppings (such as
        shaved chocolate).
      <p>Coffee is usually brewed hot, at close to the boiling point of water, immediately before drinking, yielding a
        hot beverage capable of scalding if splashed or spilled; if not consumed promptly, coffee is often sealed into a
        vacuum flask or insulated bottle to maintain its temperature. In most areas, coffee may be purchased
        unprocessed, or already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Whole roast coffee or ground coffee is often
        vacuum-packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life. Especially in hot climates, some find cold or
        iced coffee more refreshing. This can be prepared well in advance as it maintains its character when stored cold
        better than as a hot beverage.
      </p>
      <p>Even with the same roast, the character of the extraction is highly dependent on distribution of particle sizes
        produced by the grinding process, temperature of the grounds after grinding, freshness of the roast and grind,
        brewing process and equipment, temperature of the water, character of the water itself, contact time with hot
        water (less sensitive with cold water), and the brew ratio employed. Preferred brew ratios of water to coffee
        often fall into the range of 15â€“18:1 by mass; even within this fairly small range, differences are easily
        perceived by an experienced coffee drinker. Processes can range from extremely manual (e.g. hand grinding with
        manual pour-over in steady increments) to totally automated by a single appliance with a reservoir of roast
        beans which it automatically measures and grinds, and water, which it automatically heats and doses. Another
        common style of automated coffee maker is fed a single-serving "pod" of pre-measured coffee grounds for each
        beverage.</p>
